Coverity® Sonar Plug-in Installation and Configuration Guide
============================================================

Version 1.7.4

This guide is intended to assist you with the installation and
configuration of the Coverity Sonar plug-in. Once completed, you will be
able to view Coverity Analysis issues within the SonarQube environment.

Compatibility
=============

The table below displays the software versions supported by the Coverity
Sonar plug-in.

| **Software**     | **Supported versions** |
|------------------|------------------------|
| SonarQube        | 6.7.5 - 7.9.1          |
| SonarQube Scanner| 3.0 - 4.0              |
| Coverity Connect | 8.0+                   |

Installing the Coverity Sonar Plug-in
=====================================

To install the Coverity Sonar plug-in, complete the following steps.

1.  Ensure that you have SonarQube(v6.7.5 ~ v7.9.1) and SonarQube Scanner(v3.0 ~ v4.0) installed.
    Sonar installation and setup instructions are located at
    <http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Setup+and+Upgrade>.

2.  Download and unzip the Coverity Sonar plug-in to the Sonar plugins
    folder:

    &lt;SonarInstallDirectory&gt;/extensions/plugins

3.  Restart SonarQube.

Note: After upgrading SonarQube, reset the quality profile for the languages which use Coverity
(in **Quality Profiles**, select **Restore Built-in Profiles**, and select the language.)

Configuring the Coverity Sonar Plug-in
======================================

Once installed, you must configure the Coverity Sonar plug-in for
general use.

1.  Log in to SonarQube as an administrator.

2.  Click on **Administration**.

3.  Choose **Configuration &gt; General Settings**.

4.  Choose **Coverity**.

5.  Enter the appropriate information in each of the fields for your
    Coverity Connect instance. Ensure that the **Enable Coverity**
    option is set to “True” to allow the import of Coverity data.

6.  Click **Save Coverity Settings** to complete the
    basic configuration.

Configuring your Project Settings
=================================

After configuring the general plug-in settings, you must select the
correct Coverity Connect project to associate with each of your Sonar
projects.

1.  Log in to SonarQube as an administrator.

2.  Ensure that you have uploaded your project at least once (with
    SonarQube Scanner), and select the project in SonarQube.

3.  Click on **Quality Profiles**.

4.  Change the Quality Profile option for your project to
    *Coverity(&lt;language&gt;)*, and click **Update.**

5.  Choose **Configuration &gt; General Settings**.

6.  Choose **Coverity**.

7.  Ensure that the **Enable Coverity** option is set to “True” to allow
    the import of Coverity data.

8.  Enter the name of the Coverity Connect project that corresponds to
    the current Sonar project.

9.  Click **Save Coverity Settings. **

Once completed, SonarQube will pull the current Coverity Analysis data
whenever you run SonarQube Scanner on the specified project. This
configuration must be completed for each project you wish to link with
Coverity Connect.

Setting Up sonar-project.properties
===================================

For the plug-in to successfully display Coverity defects, the correct
source paths must be entered in the sonar-project.properties file at the
root of the project you are scanning. The sonar.sources variable must
contain the absolute path names of the source files. For example, on a
Linux system, the variable’s setting might look like this:

sonar.sources=/home/gwen/source/ces-tools/src/main/java

On windows it might look like this:

> sonar.sources=C:\\\\Users\\\\gwen\\\\source\\\\ces-tools\\\\src\\\\main\\\\java

See below for a complete example sonar-project.properties file. 

> \# Required metadata
>
> sonar.projectKey=My-Project-Key
>
> sonar.projectName=My-Project-Name
>
> sonar.login=admin
>
> sonar.password=admin
>
> sonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000
>
> sonar.projectVersion=1.5.0
>
> \# Comma-separated paths to directories with sources (required)
>
> sonar.sources=.
>
> \# Encoding of the source files
>
> sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
>
> sonar.coverity.connect.hostname=localhost
>
> sonar.coverity.connect.port=8080
>
> sonar.coverity.connect.username=user
>
> sonar.coverity.connect.password=password
>
> sonar.projectVersion=1.5.0
>
> sonar.coverity.stream=MyStream
>
> sonar.coverity.project=MyProject
>
> sonar.coverity.enable=true
>
> \# sonar.coverity.prefix=MyOptionalPrefix

*Note*: When using the Coverity plug-in, use the language key "cov-cpp" instead of "c", "c++", or "cpp". This language key prevents conflicts with non-Coverity plug-ins.

To specify the language key: 
-   In **Administration &gt; Coverity &gt; Languages**, configure "C/C++ source files suffixes" appropriately.
-   Make sure that **Administration &gt; Configuration &gt; Languages** and your project level settings (**Project Settings &gt; General Settings &gt; Languages**) don't contain the suffixes that you configured above to avoid conflicts. For example, if your Coverity language configuration includes <code>\*\*./\*.cpp </code>, make sure to remove <code>\*\*./\*.cpp </code> everywhere else.
-   See https://community.sonarsource.com/t/language-of-file-dal-db2-vb-can-not-be-decided-as-the-file-matches-patterns-of-2-languages/21998 and https://community.sonarsource.com/t/language-of-file-can-not-be-decided-as-the-file-matches-patterns/16246 to see example conflicts.

*Note*: The "sonar.coverity.prefix" property is used to help locate files when anlyzing with the sonar scanner. The prefix value will be removed from the "File path" value on the Coverity Connect issue.
-   the value must match exactly, if having trouble finding the source files look at the Coverity Connect issues "File" column 
-   when running analysis on windows Coverity Connect returns values with linux path separators
-   by using --strip-path during analysis this property can be avoided

*Note*: Coverity SonarQube Plugin now supports both stream and project. 
-	If **sonar.coverity.stream** is configured, then the plugin will only fetch defects from configured stream, regardless **sonar.coverity.project** is configured. 
-	If **sonar.coverity.stream** is not configured, then the plugin will use **sonar.coverity.project** to fetch defects from.


The Coverity Widget
===================

The Coverity plug-in includes a Coverity widget that displays
Coverity-specific measures. The Coverity widget is available with SonarQube versions before version 6.2.

-   The Coverity logo and the Coverity Project are both clickable links
    that take you to the Coverity Connect instance. There, you can view
    the Coverity project that contributes data to your Sonar project.
-   The Outstanding Issues count is the number of outstanding Coverity
    issues found in the most recent scan.
-   The other three counts are the numbers of issues at each of
    Coverity’s three impact levels.
-   The Coverity widget is no longer supported as of SonarQube v6.2. The metrics that 
    were displayed by the widget are shown in SonarQube under **Measures**.
-   The Coverity widget can be added to the Dashboard by two different routes: as Admin,
go to **Dashboards &gt; Manage dashboards**, or in a Project, go to **Dashboard** and add it there. 

Sonar Scanner with SSL
===================

Coverity SonarQube Plugin provides a connection to Coverity Connect through SSL. The certificates should be imported to the java key chain where Sonar Scanner is running from. 

Sonar Scanner provides its own jre bundle as part of Sonar Scanner. This means that if a user installed java locally, the certificates need to be imported to the jre which is bundled with Sonar Scanner. 

keytool -importcert -keystore <PATH_TO_SONAR_SCANNER>/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -file <CERT_FILE> -alias <ALIAS>

Limitations
===========

The Coverity Sonar plug-in has the following limitations, which may be
addressed in future releases.

-   Cannot modify data in Coverity Connect (such as triage). Data from
    Coverity Connect is read-only in Sonar.

-   A Sonar instance can only work against a single Coverity
    Connect instance.

-   Does not distinguish between Quality, Test Advisor, and
    Security issues.

-   Interacts with Coverity Connect only through web services, meaning
    the plug-in will not interact with build or analysis, and source
    code is separately maintained between Coverity Connect and Sonar.

-   No parsing of source code – the plug-in is language agnostic.

-   No creation of related Coverity Connect projects in Sonar.

-   The file paths must match exactly in Sonar and Coverity Connect;
    otherwise issue data will not be imported. However, because Coverity
    Analysis may not be performed on the same directory as Sonar
    Analysis, you may remove the beginning of the filename to make it
    relative to Sonar’s project root.

> To do so, navigate to the “Configuration -&gt; General Settings -&gt;
> Coverity” menu, and specify the prefix to be removed in the “Coverity
> Files Prefix” field.

-   There are no immediate plans for localization to languages other
    than English.
